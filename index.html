            1. Though a group of these insects are called a cloud or plague, cicadas usually don't cause the harm that locusts cause to crops and local vegetation.

            2. Cicadas are herbivores. This means they eat vegetation. Young cicadas eat liquid from plant roots, while molting cicadas eat twigs.

            3. The buzzing sound they make is a mating call. Male cicadas vibrate a white, drumlike membrane on their abdomens called a tymbal.

            Everyone loves the cuddly stuff toys teddy bears are and who doesn't love the story of 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears'? Here are some intresting facts about them:
        </h2>
        <p>
            1. The story of Goldilocks And The Three Bears was written in 1837 by Robert Southey who was the Poet Laureate at the time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. In Southey’s original story, the visitor to the bears’ house was an ugly old woman. Goldilocks only entered the tale in later versions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3. In the Chinese version it is actually Goldy luck and the three pandas. In this story it is Chinese New Year and Goldy luck wreaks havoc upon a house belonging to the three bears. She eats the smallest bear's rice porridge,breaks his rocking chair,and rumples the little bears blankets on his futon. But when she apologizes she makes a new friend and a plate of turnip cakes just in time for Chinese New Year.
